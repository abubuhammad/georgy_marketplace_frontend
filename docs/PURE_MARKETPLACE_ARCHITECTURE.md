# Pure Marketplace Architecture

## Overview

Your platform follows a **Pure Marketplace Model** where specific user roles create specific types of content. This is similar to platforms like Amazon (sellers list products), Zillow (agents list properties), and LinkedIn (employers post jobs).

## Architectural Decision: **No Generic "Post Ad"**

We've **removed the `/post-ad` route** in favor of role-specific content creation paths. This provides:

- ✅ **Better user experience** - specialized forms for specialized needs
- ✅ **Higher quality listings** - role-appropriate fields and validation
- ✅ **Quality control** - verified users creating content in their expertise
- ✅ **Monetization opportunities** - role-based pricing and features

## User Role → Content Type Mapping
